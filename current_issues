Current Issues:

- Recency effect too weak
	- not all new words are attended (this failure is more likely towards the end of the study phase - I think)
	- sometimes it will fail to recall the WM items (not very often though)

- Primacy effect too strong

To reproduce issues:

- use experiment_murdock file
- make sure it uses "general_free_recall_model_v2.lisp" as model
- you can set the number of agents at the beginning of the experiment_murdock file (setting shouldn't affect the error though)
- below the cell that defines all the functions (such as do_experiment), there are two cells of (not so nice) code. At the top of the first one you can set the number of lists per agent and the experimental conditions
	- experimental conditions are taken from Murdock (as presented in Kahana) --> [2, 15], [2, 20], [1, 20], [1, 40] --> [rehearsal time, number of words]
	- keeping the conditions as is should reproduce the issues mentioned above.

--> the file runs through all 4 conditions for the set number of agents (and for each agent the set number of lists!) and plots the serial position curve for each condition.

Also currently the code generates a folder within the murdock folder named agent_{num_agents}. To plot the results, it reads the data from there again and aggregates it. So, if you run the file for say 100 agents the folder will be filled with the results from that run. If you were to run it again for 100 agents (but change other settings) the results will be placed in the same folder. Consequently, the plot would then incorporate the results not just from the second run, but also from the first. Hence, you'll need to delete the folder (or its contents) before running again.
