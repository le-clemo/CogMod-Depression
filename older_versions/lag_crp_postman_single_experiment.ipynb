    "## What is CRP?\n",
    "    - After recalling the first list item, participants make transitions to items from other list positions. Given that a participant has just recalled an item from serial position i, and that the next recall is from serial position j, we can measure the relation between recall probability and the lag between i and j—that is, the number of items separating i and j at study. This measure is called the conditional-response probability as a function of lag, or lag-CRP.\n",
    "    - lag = (i-j) \n",
    "    - recall probability : calculated as usual\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Unit Tests\n",
    "    -For example, if the list had contained the subsequence absence hollow pupil and a participant recalled hollow, then pupil, the recall of pupil would have a lag of +1. If, instead, the participant recalled hollow, then absence, the transition to absence would be associated with a lag of -1. In this case, the participant is moving backward in the list; absence followed by pupil would yield a lag of +2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Reference plot in Kahana\n",

    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### This plot contains data of 20 different free recall experiments with different lists, different words,different presentation rates.\n",
    "    -Yet, in all these studies, successively recalled items were far more likely to come from nearby serial positions\n",
    "    than from remote serial positions (Howard & Kahana, 1999; Kahana, 1996;Kahana, Howard, Zaromb, & Wingfield, 2002).\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Curve Characteristics\n",
    "    The lag-CRP function has two invariant characteristics: \n",
    "    (1) The function decreases systematically as absolute lag increases, approaching an asymptotic value at large lags; the asymptotic value depends almost exclusively on list length, with lower asymptotic values for longer lists. \n",
    "    (2) For small absolute lags, the function is consistently asymmetric, with an approximately 2:1ratio favoring forward over backward recall transitions. The basic patternhas been confirmed in a number of studies (e.g., Howard & Kahana, 1999;Kahana et al., 2002; Ward, Woodward, Stevens, & Stinson, 2003; Zarombet al., 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "    In immediate free recall, the lag-CRP changes shape over the course of recall. Specifically, early in recall (i.e., at early output positions) the lag- CRP is steeply peaked. This reflects bleed-in from the recency effect, where the last 2 or 3 study items tend to be recalled as a cluster prior to recall of other items. The lag-CRP function remains stable across later output positions, thus reflecting the general tendency to make associative transitions in retrieval. In delayed free recall, recency is reduced or eliminated, and the lag-CRP remains stable across all output positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to implement\n",
    "    The conditional-response probability for a transition of a certain lag is calculated by first tallying the number of times a transition of that lag was made, and then dividing that tally by the number of times a transition of that lag could have been made. Possible transitions do not include those in which \n",
    "    (a) the lag is outside the bounds of the list (e.g., negative lags following\n",
    "    recall of the first list item), or \n",
    "    (b) the item has already been recalled. \n",
    "    Strictly speaking, these types of transitions are not always impossible—participants occasionally make prior-list intrusions and sometimes they repeat previously recalled items. Such transitions are extremely rare, however, in comparison to within-list lags to items that were not previously recalled."
